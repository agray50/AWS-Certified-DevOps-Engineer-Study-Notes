### AWS Config  
- **Capabilities**  
  - Tracks config changes, compliance dashboards, integrates with QuickSight.  
  - Supports **Config Rules** (managed or custom with Lambda).  
  - Triggers: config changes OR periodic.  
  - Automations: revert drifted configs, create golden AMIs, recover instances.  
- **Aggregators**  
  - Aggregate compliance data across accounts/regions.

### SSM (Systems Manager)  
- **Run Command**: bootstrap apps, join domains, capture logs.  
- **Patch Manager**: preconfigured baselines, hybrid EC2/on-premises, schedule via maintenance windows.  
- **Automation**: build AMIs, remediate drift, rollback configs.  

### AWS Storage Gateway  
- **File Gateway**: NFS/SMB access â†’ S3.  
- **Volume Gateway**: iSCSI block storage.  
- **Tape Gateway**: VTL â†’ Glacier.  
- `RefreshCache` refreshes S3 bucket inventory.  

### AWS Application Discovery Service  
- **Agentless**: OVA for VMware vCenter.  
- **Agent-based**: install agent on each server.

## Domain 3: Monitoring, Logging, and Performance Tuning (15%)  

### CloudWatch  
- **ASG Metrics**: deploy can stop if CloudWatch alarm triggered.  
- **Log Subscriptions**: send logs in real-time â†’ Lambda, Kinesis Stream, Kinesis Firehose.  
- **CloudWatch â†’ Kinesis â†’ S3**: for analytics/archiving.  

### AWS X-Ray  
- Traces distributed applications.  
- **Insights**: detect anomalies and outliers.  
- Integrates with **Lambda** (enable tracing, IAM role for X-Ray).  
- Configure **groups + EventBridge rules + alarms**.  

### AWS Trusted Advisor  
- Cost, security, performance, fault tolerance, service quotas.  
- Integrated with **EventBridge + CloudWatch**.  

### AWS Health Dashboard  
- Personalized view of AWS events impacting your resources.  
- Integrated with **EventBridge** for proactive remediation.  

### CloudTrail Log Integrity Validation  
- Uses SHA-256 hash + RSA signature â†’ detect tampering of logs.  

---

## Domain 4: Policies and Standards Automation (10%)  

### AWS Config (Compliance Automation)  
- Detect & auto-remediate drift with **SSM Automation**.  
- Example: EC2 must run on dedicated host â†’ custom Config rule + Lambda.  

### Audit Account Logging  
- Centralized logging with **Kinesis Data Streams + Lambda + OpenSearch**.  
- Subscription filters forward logs from sub-accounts â†’ Audit account.  

### Amazon Inspector  
- Automated vulnerability assessment.  
- Scans EC2 network accessibility and app security state.  

---

## Domain 5: Incident and Event Response (18%)  

### Route53  
- **Failover Routing Policy**  
  - Health checks â†’ non-alias records.  
  - Alias records must set *Evaluate Target Health = Yes*.  

### ASG Lifecycle Hooks  
- **Launch flow**: Pending â†’ Pending:Wait â†’ Pending:Proceed â†’ InService.  
- **Terminate flow**: Terminating â†’ Terminating:Wait â†’ Terminating:Proceed â†’ Terminated.  
- Hooks allow customization before instance is InService/terminated.  

### Transit Gateway
